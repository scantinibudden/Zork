# Zork

## Description
Zork (Name To Change) is a single player command-line game. Indulge yourself in a fantasy world full of adventures, and turn based combat. Be able to create your own story and share it with others.

Inspired in games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Dungeons & Dragons. I wish to create not only a game but a tool to easily create, share and play different stories that utilize the same core mechanics.
